#Free Flight alpha testing

###General Information

* Date: Jul 20th 2014
* Version 0.2.2


##Testing

Alpha testing for the people below.

I should note some things that were true for all below players:

* They played on a small laptop with a very small 11 inch screen
* They played outside, so the lighting was bad, and it was hard to see the game
* None of them were veteran video game players 


###Player Kevin L. 

Player had not played video games before. He had to be told the basic controls (never looked at the 'controls' box), and started flying immediately after finding out the flight button. Since I had told him the 'move' buttons were the 'wasd' controls, he expected those to be the flight controls as well. This took a couple of minutes for him to learn. 

He played for several minutes, and focused on finding various ridges to land on. Given his experience as a paraglider pilot, this was higher interest to him. He grasped the concept of holding spacebar for flapping, but had to be told about flaring (which he didn't use, because of the camera issue) and never even touched the 'diving' controls. 

The experience was generally a good one. He enjoyed it. 

###Player Rich S. 

Player works in the games industry, but doesn't play video games himself. He had to be told the basic controls, and also assumed 'wasd' would work the same on the ground as it did in flight. He never looked up at the 'controls' box in the upper right hand corner. He walked around a little before he began flying. He held spacebar down, but had to ask if he was flapping or not (he wasn't sure). Player held down the flap button until he was high above the level. 

He played several minutes. His focus was on getting high enough to fly to various ridges on glide. Based on his experience as a fixed wing/small aircraft pilot, getting far from the ground was important to him. 

It took a long time for him to get comfortable with the controls. He continually expected 'a' and 'd' to turn him, although the mouse was responsible for those controls (and both those keys were utterly useless in flight). The idea for moving the mouse to control direction seemed un-intuitive to him (I thought). 

The experience was generally a good one!

###Player 'daughter of Para Pilot Carl' 

Player was a younger girl, who may or may not have had a little prior game experience. She needed to be told the controls, but eventually picked them up. She also had trouble with the controls in flight compared to on the ground. She never looked up at the 'controls' box. 

She understood flapping, but I don't think she did much else. It took her a while to get used to the mouse controls, and like the others, she expected the keyboard to be used to turn her, not the mouse. 

She played for around 30-45 minutes, and explored the whole entire map. She fell out of the world several times, and restarted the game. Overall, she seemed to have fun!

BUG DISCOVERED! -- On restart, she found that all controls, except look controls, were frozen. If the player manually pauses/unpauses the game, all the controls unlock and the game works normally. I think this is due to the 'restart' functionality not properly 'unpausing' the game when it's clicked. Another known bug allows look controls to be active even when paused, which further leads me to believe the bug is related to 'unpausing'.
