 * Flight Mechanics is responsible for converting user input into

 * 
 * It handles the math behind flapping, flarring, diving,
 * to change how physics effects the flight object.
 * 
 * Example: In order to do a 'dive', this class reduces the
 * wing area. flight physics then calculates smaller lift forces,
 * allowing the flight object to plummet.
