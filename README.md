=================

A Unity Package to add gliding flight to any Unity Object.

####Warning 

	This only applies if you cloned this project before Sept 11, 2014

The project underwent a massive history maintenance for all commits and tags, to clean out all unnecessary files. The history hasn't functionally changed, but all commit hashes and tags are now different, which will make you unable to issue a pull-request if you still have the old history.

To fix this, please force pull all tags and history, or re-clone the project. If this in any way bungled what you were working on, and you are unsure of how to proceed, send a message [here](http://windwardproductions.org/contact/) and I will personally help you out. 

###Description

Have you ever wanted to create a game where you can fly over the precipitous mountainsides? Perhaps you want to show the world from a birds-eye perspective. Or, maybe your game has nothing to do with flight, you just want various birds to systematically poop on everything in a realistic fashion. Now you can!

Unity Free Flight aims to add a realistic layer of flight dynamics to Unity Objects. That is, you want something to fly? Add this script to the object, and now it can! 

It's true, there are plenty of flight simulators out there already. And maybe [they are what you're looking for](http://unityfs.chris-cheetham.com/). But most flight simulators are geared towards powered flight. That is, flying fighter jets or metal crafts. This Free Flight package is intended for slow moving craft, or winged creatures such as birds. Such objects are also at the [mercy of wind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV6dLtBJVFQ), [thermals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV5w8EmqV5c)([what are those?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal)), or [thunder storm gust fronts](http://youtu.be/RkD4u6sW0LU?t=4m25s). 

Slow moving flight allows for some [incredible perspective](http://www.paraglidinghd.com/urban-side-paragliding/).
