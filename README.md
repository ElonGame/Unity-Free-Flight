Unity-Free-Flight
=================

A Unity Package to provide bird-like flight to Unity Game Objects.

####Warning 

	This only applies if you cloned this project before Sept 11, 2014

The project underwent a massive history maintenance for all commits and tags, to clean out all unnecessary files. The history hasn't functionally changed, but all commit hashes and tags are now different, which will make you unable to issue a pull-request if you still have the old history.

To fix this, please force pull all tags and history, or re-clone the project. If this in any way bungled what you were working on, and you are unsure of how to proceed, send a message [here](http://windwardproductions.org/contact/) and I will personally help you out. 

###Description

Have you ever wanted to fly from a [birds perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3QrhdfLCO8 "Youtube of GoPro mounted on an Eagle in flight")? To soar through a canyon, stalking your prey from above, waiting for the right time to fold wings, dive, and strike! Maybe you need a fast travel system for your RPG, and you want to give your players more than just a pre-scripted flight path, to explore your expansive world from above. 

You've come to the right place!

Free Flight is designed to add a realistic layer of slow-moving flight to Unity. That means the ability to flap, wing-fold dive, barrel roll, flare -- anything a bird is able to do this package will emulate. Furthermore, each of these actions is continuous: flight maneuvers change based on the speed and rotation they're executed, allowing for advanced players to learn new and complicated strategies. 

###You have my attention, how do I get started?

###That was neat, now how do I use it in *my* game?
