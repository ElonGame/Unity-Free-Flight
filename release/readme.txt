All builds and packaged releases are intended to be built here.

The version number at the top of version.txt will determine
the folder where each packaged build will go.  


Building for OSX:
Make sure the version number is set, then simply run the build 
script, and everything should work:

./build.sh
--OR--
bash build.sh

Building for Windows:

There is no current auto-build in place for windows.

Building for Linux:

There is no current auto-build in place for linux.
